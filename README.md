# 2d-raytracing

python implementation for very basic 2D-raytracing.

The window is split in two parts :
- The right widow is a 3D rendered view of the map on the left view
- The left window is a top down view of a map. The player is the dot, can be moved with right click and rotated with the arrow keys (left / right). The left click can be used to create walls on the map.
